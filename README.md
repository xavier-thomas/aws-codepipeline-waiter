## Overview
### How it works
The incoming **UserParameters** object on the AWS CodePipeline invocation event will have the target pipeline name and the ARN of a role with permissions to monitor it.
Invoking the lambda from a pipeline will:
* Assume the cross account role
* Generate secure temporary credentials using that role.
* Find the status of the target pipeline
* Send a continuation token to the invoking pipeline if the target pipeline is still in progress. Which will cause the invoking pipeline to poll the lambda periodically until the target pipeline succeeds.
* Send a failure / success signal to the invoking pipeline if the target pipeline has failed or succeeded.
