## Overview
### How it works
The incoming **UserParameters** object on the AWS CodePipeline invocation event will have the target pipeline name and the ARN of a role with permissions to monitor it.
Invoking the lambda from a pipeline will:
* Assume the cross account role
* Generate secure temporary credentials using that role.
* Find the status of the target pipeline
* Send a continuation token to the invoking pipeline if the target pipeline is still in progress. Which will cause the invoking pipeline to poll the lambda periodically until the target pipeline succeeds.
* Send a failure / success signal to the invoking pipeline if the target pipeline has failed or succeeded.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
To clone and run this application, you'll need Git, Node.js and npm installed. You can also use an alternative package manager, such as Yarn if you prefer!

### Installing
From your favourite command line tool, run the following:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MetOffice/pipeline-monitor-lambda.git

# Install dependencies
npm ci
```

### Running tests
From your favourite command line tool, run the following:
```bash
# Run the unit tests
npm test
```

### Linting & code formatting
From your favourite command line tool, run the following:
```bash
# Run the linter
$ npm run lint
```

## Invoking the Lambda
### Inputs
The lambda expects the following UserParameters to be supplied during invocation:
```JSON
{
    "targetname": "target-pipeline-name",
    "assumerolename": "arn:aws:iam::${AccountId}:role/PipelineMonitoringRole-${Tier}"
}
```
